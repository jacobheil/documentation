Here's a link to our [Audacity tutorial](https://github.com/wooster-core/Documentation/blob/master/Abridged%20Audacity%20Tutorial%20Markdown.md).

We're a team of four people. Katie is a junior, Komal is a junior, and Anushkaa is a freshman; Jacob is our boss. We code, help people out, and all in all, we love computer science!

TESTING for branches.
